3. how to get max value from this course
   1. grab a hot drink, cake , warm blanket if you have to  - lol
   2. keep your spirit high.. lol
   3. pause every 30 seconds and typ code 
   4. timotius phamungkas - accept - unusual and weird accept
   5. manually generated subtitles
   6. turn on subs if needed
   7. dont skip lectures - 
   8. if you get stuck in a lecture - it is ok - it is the joy of learning new things
   9. we can feel such happy feeling when we overcome challenge :)
   10. Q&A of course
   11. stack overflow
   12. 

4. Technology in this course
 
   1. rabbitmq3.x --> rabbitmq 3.8
   2. prior 3.8 is still ok
   3. rabbitmq version 
   4.  as long as 3.x it should be ok 
   5.  java 15 used in this course --> can use any starting from java 8
   6.  var keyword for data type
   7.  spring boot 2 
   9. resrouces and reference 
  10. 

5.  Messaging systems

    1. messaging system is communication mechanism for application to application (A2A)
    2. handle messages among apps and systems thruout an organization
    3. integrate applications! 
    4. example use case 
        in a company there are several systems
        i.e. human resource system
        i.e. marketing system
        i.e. active directory 
 
        
data will come to human resource system --> marketing system will pull data from human 
resource system. marketing system process that data 

human resource will push data to active directory as a text file say at 1am
daily process at 2am

1.data come to human resource system
2.human resource system will send incoming data in real time to rabbitmq
3. both marketing system and active directory receive incoming data and each of them
   will process it according to their requirement
4. source application -->  
   target application -->
if got many integration points, then many integration points! 
   different implementations! 

5. with messaging system
   1. messaging system allows you to decouple your application and data communication
   2. source data sends data to messaging system
   3. target application takes it! 
   4. send data in json
   5. messaging system use case : 
    
6. with rabbit mq.. data can be put on the queue to be processed later.. data locking avoided

rabbit mq
1. introduction - 
2. open source messaging system - dont have to pay fee to use it
3. rabbitMQ queue
4. rabbitmq is reliable
5. can use rabbitmq on cloud
6. rabbitmq - excellent prog lang support
7. 

java and spring
1. java prog language more than 20 years
2. top three most used programming languages
3. regular updates
4. starting from java 10 - twice release every year
5. runs on top of jvm
6. so can run on any platform 
7. oracle & open source implementation like open jdk 
8. use frameworks- spring boot -to increase productivity 
9. with plain java -- need alot of boilerplate code
10. spring boot - no more xml! 
11. config files
12. start.spring.io
13. spring modules or projects
14. spring technology stack
    1. microservice
    2. sql and nosql
    3. load balancer and api gateway
    4. kafka and rabbitmq
    5. 

15. eclipse 
    1. spring tools suite
    2. official project from spring  
    3. provide ready to use features 
    4. we will use spring tool suite in this course! 

gradle - build automation tool 
maintaining library manually is nightmare
dependency management


to install rabbitmq , must install erlang first
download erlang   - http://www.erlang.org/downloads
download rabbitmq - https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html
rabbit mq is written in erlang

make sure to start the rabbitmq service
